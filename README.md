The game allows the user to guess letters by typing them into an input field. The game updates the display to show the correctly guessed letters, underscores **_ _ _** for unguessed letters, and updates the attempt count. If the user runs out of attempts, it displays the correct word. If the user guesses the entire word correctly, it displays a victory message.
The word is randomly picked from the word list from my ``` script file ```. Every time you refresh the page, a new word is picked.

Give it a trial and see how it goes. All the best!
